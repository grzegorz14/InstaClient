# InstaClient android

This project is a simplified copy of Instagram mobile app. All data comes from InstaAPI server (other project in my repos) by Retrofit communication.
App allows to:
- register/login users
- display posts (image or video)
- add posts (image or video from cameraX) and describe them
- add localization to posts (google maps fragment)
- display user profiles and posts
- edit user data and profile photo
- edit post data
- add filter to image or rotate it (provided by server with Sharp library)

Uploads folder contains uploaded files and initial example files.
Endpoints are tested by simple http requests in tests folder.

Appearance was inspired on Instagram mobile app.
